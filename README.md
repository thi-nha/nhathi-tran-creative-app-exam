# **nhathi-tran-creative-app-exam**
Final assignment for the seminar "Creative applications of Python and AI" of the summer semester 2024.

## **Project Overview**
This project creates images of a flower with varying petal colors using Python's Pillow library. The project generates a series of images and compiles them into a video. Additionally, the video is converted into a GIF (that will bes used later for the QR Code below), and a music file is generated by an ai and combined with the video to produce a final multimedia piece.

## **Installation Instructions**
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/thi-nha/nhathi-tran-creative-app-exam.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd flower-image-video-generator

3. **Install the Required Dependencies:**
Install the dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## **Usage Instructions**
To generate the flower images, video, and add music:

1. **Run the Python Script:**
   ```bash
   python create_musicvideo_flower.py

2. **Output Files:**
   - The generated images will be saved in the images directory.
   - The video will be saved as flower.mp4 in the video directory.
   - The GIF will be saved as flower.gif in the video directory.
   - The music file will be saved as audio.wav in the music directory.
   - The final video with music will be saved as flower_w_music.mp4 in the final_result directory.

## **Methodology**
### **Idea and Motivation**
My idea was to take the inputs from the seminars on the various creative possibilities of using Python and ultimately summarize them in a multimedia video. Art also means drawing inspiration from others and experimenting with what has been learned to create something new.
I adapted and expanded upon the code snippets that we discussed piece by piece in the seminars, to create a music file using AI and compile images into a video.
The goal was to create images of a flower and compile them into a multimedia video that includes an audio file generated through Python using AI.




### **Development Process**
**1. Research:**
- Investigated various image generation techniques using the Pillow library.
- Explored methods for combining images into videos and adding music using MoviePy and other Python tools.

**2. Implementation:**
- **Image Generation**: Multiple images of a flower are generated with varying petal colors.
- **Video Creation**: The images are compiled into a video, repeated twice to create a longer sequence.
- **GIF Creation*+: The video is converted into a GIF.
- **Music Generation**: A music file is generated based on a text prompt using a pre-trained model.
- **Final Video**: The music is added to the video, creating the final multimedia piece.

## **Video**

Here is a QR Code to my video where you can see my demo of creating a musicvideo.

## **Credits**
This project uses the following libraries and resources:
- **Pillow**: For image creation and manipulation.
- **OpenCV**: For video creation.
- **MoviePy**: For video and GIF processing.
- **Transformers** (HuggingFace): For generating music using a pre-trained model.
